        <p>
        	These violent delights have violent ends
        	<br>
			And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
			<br>
			Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
			<br>
			Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
			<br>
			And in the taste confounds the appetite:
			<br>
			Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
			<br>
			Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
